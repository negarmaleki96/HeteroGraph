# Social Network Prediction Problems: Using Meta-Paths and Dynamic Heterogeneous Graph Representation for Label Propagation

This paper introduces a dynamic heterogeneous graph representation for social networks, addressing previous limitations by incorporating multiplexity of connections and time into every graph component. Demonstrating its effectiveness, the paper showcases four time-dependent queries and a deep learning task using the Steemit social media platform as a case study.
